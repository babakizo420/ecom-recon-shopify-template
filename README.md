## Recon Report: Dormant Shopify Store (target-ecom-store.com)

A real-world recon walkthrough of an inactive Shopify e-commerce site using passive OSINT techniques only.
All scans were performed on public endpoints. No login, intrusion, or exploitation.

---

## Objective

Understand how much can be discovered about a target from passive recon alone.

- **Target:** `target-ecom-store.com`
- **Status:** Store unavailable — Shopify 402

---

## Recon Steps

### 1. DNS TXT Records
```bash
dig txt target-ecom-store.com
```
- No TXT records
- Hosted on Google Domains (ns-cloud-d1)

### 2. SSL Certificate Inspection
```bash
openssl s_client -connect target-ecom-store.com:443
```
- Valid TLS certificate (Google Trust Services)
- Uses TLS 1.3, strong cipher suite
- Expires in ~90 days
- No handshake errors

### 3. HTTP Headers + Status Check
```bash
curl -I https://target-ecom-store.com
```
- HTTP/2 402 Payment Required
- Powered by Shopify
- Headers show CSP, HSTS, Cloudflare, etc.
- Indicates paused or inactive storefront

### 4. Tech Fingerprinting
```bash
whatweb https://target-ecom-store.com
```
- Shopify detected
- Cloudflare CDN
- HTML5 + jQuery
- Hosted in Canada

---

## Automation

Run all 4 steps with the included script:

```bash
chmod +x recon.sh
./recon.sh target-ecom-store.com
```

---

## Conclusion

Even "offline" stores leak:

- TLS metadata
- Hosting and CDN info
- Shopify-specific headers
- Useful for asset discovery, threat mapping, and client pre-audit reports
